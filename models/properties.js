/**
 * User Methods & Authentication
 *
 * Bcrypt is an encryption library. It's used here to secure passwords.
 * This is done in two steps:
 *
 * 1. Hash: Encrypt the plain password into a cipher
 * 2. Salt: An additional secure string used to 'unlock' the cipher
 *
 * REMEMBER: PASSWORDS ARE NEVER STORED.
 *
 * They are scrambled into a long, random string. Then when a user
 * logs in, that string is checked by:
 *
 * 1. Encrypting it using the salt.
 * 2. Checking that the new cipher matches the old.
